<Warning>
**Important prerequisite:**  
This guide only works if you own the WABA account as a company and can see it in your Meta Business Manager. If the WABA account is managed by your previous provider, contact us for alternative transfer options.
</Warning>

## 1. Disconnect WABA from old partner

In the Meta Business Suite:
- Go to **Business Settings > Accounts > WhatsApp Accounts > Partners**
- Click the **trash icon** next to the previous partner and confirm **"Unshare"**

## 2. Embedded signup with your new solution partner DialogShift

- Open the **embedded signup link** provided by us
- Select your **existing WABA** in the flow when asked

## 3. Capture WABA ID (and Cloud API phone number)

Our system automatically transfers the WABA ID (and for Cloud API the business phone number) after completion.

## 4. Add credit card as payment source

In the Meta Business Suite:
- Go to **Business Settings > Payments > Payment Methods**
- Click **"Add payment method"**, enter your credit card details and set it as **Primary**
- From now on, all template and session costs will be charged directly to your card
