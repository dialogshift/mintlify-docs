## How Do Guests Reach Your Hotel via WhatsApp?

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="QR Code Website">
    QR code on your hotel website for scanning (see video example)
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="QR Code On-Site">
    QR codes in the hotel or on marketing print materials

<Warning>
  **Important:** For privacy reasons, WhatsApp does not allow initial greetings from companies. The guest must always send the first message. With DialogShift, this message is pre-filled in the input field when scanning the QR code.
</Warning>
