Before you can use a phone number for WhatsApp Business API, it must be disconnected from all existing WhatsApp accounts.

<Warning>
**⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTE:**  
When disconnecting, ALL data on the original device will be permanently deleted:
- All chat histories
- Saved media
- Contacts and groups
- Backup data

**Nothing changes for your contacts** - they keep their chat history with your number.
