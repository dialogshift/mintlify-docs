## Preparing for Verification

<Steps>
  <Step title="Ensure data alignment">
    **All information must match 100%:**
    - Company name (exactly as in commercial register)
    - Complete address
    - Website URL
    
    Check your information in the [Business Manager](https://business.facebook.com/settings/info)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Optimize website">
    **Your website must contain:**
    - ✅ Imprint with complete address
    - ✅ Company name (identical to registration)
    - ✅ Contact information
    - ✅ Current content (no "Coming Soon" pages)
    - ✅ HTTPS encryption
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Prepare documents">
    **Accepted documents (one is sufficient):**
    - Commercial register extract (recommended, max. 12 months old)
    - Business registration
    - Tax assessment
    - Bank statement with company data
    - Utility company invoice
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
**Resolve name deviations:**  
Hotel operates as "Hotel Seeblick" but company is called "Müller GmbH"?  
Add to website footer: *"Hotel Seeblick - A company of Müller GmbH"*
</Tip>

## Performing Verification

### Step 1: Access Security Center

  Start verification here
</Card>

### Step 2: Choose verification method

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Document Upload ⭐">
    **Recommended - Works reliably**
    
    1. Click "Start business verification"
    2. Select "Upload official document"
    3. Upload commercial register extract as PDF/JPG
    4. Fill in all fields correctly
    5. Submit and wait for review
    
    **Duration:** 1-5 business days
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Automatic Verification">
    **Often problematic - Not recommended**
    
    Meta tries to find your business in databases.
    Rarely works for:
    - Smaller companies
    - Newer firms
    - Specific industries
    
    On failure: Switch to document method
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## After Submission

<Info>
**What happens now?**
1. Meta reviews your documents (1-5 business days)
2. You receive an email with the result
3. On success: Automatic activation of extended limits

</Info>

## Common Rejection Reasons

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Data doesn't match">
    **Problem:** Name/address deviates
    **Solution:** Ensure exact match with commercial register
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Website incomplete">
    **Problem:** Missing information on website
    **Solution:** Complete imprint, prominently place company name
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Document not readable">
    **Problem:** Poor scan quality
    **Solution:** Use high-resolution scan (min. 300 DPI)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Document too old">
    **Problem:** Document older than 12 months
    **Solution:** Request current extract
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

### Verification taking too long?
- Normal is 1-5 business days
- After 7 days: Contact support
- Weekends don't count as business days

### Rejected multiple times?
1. Check ALL data for exact match
2. Use a different document
3. Contact Meta Business Support

### Check status
Check verification status at:
**Business Manager → Security Center → Business Verification**

<Warning>
**Important:** Don't change company data in Business Manager during review, as this restarts the process!
</Warning>

## After Successful Verification

✅ Messaging limit increases to 1,000 contacts/day  
✅ Further increases possible after 7 days  
✅ Access to extended API features  
✅ Possibility to apply for OBA (green checkmark)  

<Tip>
Verification applies to the entire Business Manager - you only need to do it once!
