When the Live Chat option is activated, you can receive direct messages from guests.

<Info>
  Live Chats are created when:

  - The chatbot cannot find a suitable answer
  - A visitor manually selects Live Chat
  - The Phone AI has recorded a callback request from a guest

## Access Live Chats

Left navigation bar: >> **Live Chat**

## Understanding Chat Status

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Open" icon="inbox">
    Messages waiting for response
  </Card>
  <Card title="Parked" icon="pause">
    The hotel has responded to the guest's chat request and parks the chat until the guest responds.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Closed" icon="check">
    Chat closed, chatbot takes over again
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
  **Parked chats** are still in Live Chat mode:

  - With new message → automatically **Open** again
  - After 24h inactivity → automatically **Closed**
</Warning>

## Understanding "Park Chat"

After the hotel team has responded to a guest's Live Chat request, we recommend parking the chat. In a parked chat, two things can happen:

1. The guest responds, for example with a follow-up question, and a notification to the hotel team is triggered again.
2. The guest reads the message and their information need is satisfied. They don't respond anymore. Here the system automatically closes the chat after 24 hours.

In both cases, the system manages the future state of the chat and allows systematic processing of open requests.

## Additional Functions

- **Assignments:** Chats can be assigned to specific inboxes or people (upper chat window)
- **Text blocks:** Create pre-made responses via the three dots in the lower chat window
