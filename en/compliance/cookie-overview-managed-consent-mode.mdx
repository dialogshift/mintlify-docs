## General information

For the chat service, we use cookies that—if consent is given—are stored in the browser. Cookies are small text files that pass information (e.g., website usage) to the party setting the cookie. This can be the website operator or the chat provider (DialogShift GmbH). Cookies do not run programs and do not contain viruses. They help improve usability and stability, for example by providing the chat history.
