Before you can reset your password, you must be logged out of the DialogShift app.

1. Navigate to: https://app.dialogshift.com/login
2. Click on "Forgot password"
3. Enter your username which is the same as your email address
4. Our system will send you a 6-digit code via email (also check your spam folder if you don't find it immediately)
5. Enter the code along with a new password
6. Log in with your username and the new password.
