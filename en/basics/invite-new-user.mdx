In this article, you'll learn how to invite new users to your DialogShift app and define their access rights (roles).

## Inviting a User

Follow these steps to send an invitation:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to User Management">
    1. Click on `Organization settings` in the left navigation bar.
    2. Select `User management` from the submenu that appears.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter Invitation Details">
    On the "User management" page, you'll find the "Invite new users" section. Fill out the following fields:

    1. **Enter email:** Enter the email address of the person you want to invite (e.g., `tester@dialogshift.com`).
    2. **Role:** Select the appropriate user role from the dropdown menu. Each role has different permissions. A detailed explanation of roles can be found below.
    3. **Organization name:** Please ignore this field. It is not needed for the invitation.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Assign Permissions">
    Depending on the selected role, you need to specify which areas the new user should have access to:

    * **For roles `Member`, `Editor`, and `Hotel admin`:**
      Select the specific inboxes (e.g., hotels or locations) in the `Main Inboxes` field that the user should have access to.
    * **For the `Brand admin` role:**
      Select the brand for which the user should receive admin rights.
    * **For the `Admin` role:**
      This field is disabled since an admin automatically has access to all areas of the organization.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Send Invitation">
    Click the `Invite` button. The invited user will now receive an email with a link for registration.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Managing Sent Invitations

Below the invitation form, you'll find the list of `Invited users`. Here you can see all pending invitations and manage them.

For each invitation, you have two options:

-   **Delete**: Deletes the invitation. The link becomes invalid.
-   **Copy link**: Copies the invitation link to your clipboard. This is useful if the email didn't arrive and you want to send the link manually through another channel (e.g., messenger).
