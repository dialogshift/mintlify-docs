## Important Notes

### General Notes

<Note>
Add knowledge **only in one language**. The AI translates this into the other languages offered.
</Note>

<Warning>
Only add pages that provide added value for a (potential) hotel guest, **quality over quantity** applies. For the AI to function optimally, it should not be overwhelmed with information or fed with contradictory information.
</Warning>

<Info>
Images or maps cannot be read.
</Info>

### Special Notes for URLs

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Add individual URLs" icon="link">
    Add **only individual URLs**. It's not sufficient to store the central website address (e.g., https://www.hotel.com).
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Consider AI limitations" icon="robot">
    **Note that the AI cannot click.** This means only the content of the actual URL is read and no content that lies behind buttons there.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Legal aspects" icon="shield-check">
    **Only add URLs whose content you control and that legally belong to your hotel.**
