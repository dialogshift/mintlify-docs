Our AI chatbot is designed for digital guest communication – but can also be effectively used to support your staff. Especially for onboarding new team members or structured knowledge transfer in daily operations, it provides valuable assistance.

## Option 1: Using the Existing Guest Chatbot for Staff (Free)

The existing chatbot – e.g., on your website – can easily be made available to your staff as well. This can be done through the following methods:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="QR Code" icon="qrcode">
    Placed in team rooms or on information materials
  </Card>
  <Card title="Staff App" icon="mobile">
    Integration into an existing staff app
  </Card>
  <Card title="Intranet" icon="globe">
    Links on intranet pages or tablets in the back office
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Especially for new team members who are not yet familiar with all the details of the property, the chatbot provides easy access to important information – 24/7 and in many languages!

<Note>
**Note:** This option can be used without additional costs. Simply let us know how and where your staff should access the chatbot – we'll handle the technical integration.

## Option 2: Internal Chatbot with Dedicated Knowledge Database

**Costs: €50/month + one-time €250 setup**

In addition to the existing solution for guests, a **standalone chatbot specifically for internal purposes** can also be implemented. This is filled with specific knowledge for your team – e.g.:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Operational Processes">
    - How to create an invoice?
    - What to consider for early departures?
    - How does the shift change work?
  </Step>
  <Step title="Property-Specific Knowledge">
    - Internal procedures and protocols
    - Emergency procedures
    - Cross-departmental information
  </Step>
  <Step title="Training and Onboarding">
    - Standardized training content
    - FAQ for new employees
    - Reference guide for daily work
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
**Important:** There is no login – the chatbot is available to anyone who scans the QR code or accesses it through an appropriate interface.
</Warning>

This solution is ideal for standardizing and digitalizing internal knowledge processes.
