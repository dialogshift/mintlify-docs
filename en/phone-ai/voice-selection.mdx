## Selection Tips

When choosing the right voice, you should consider the following points:

- **Target audience**: Choose a voice that fits your target audience (e.g., younger/older, formal/informal)
- **Use case**: For service hotlines, friendly, clear voices are suitable
- **Brand identity**: The voice should match your corporate image
- **Comprehensibility**: Test the voice with typical technical terms from your field

<Info>
Voice selection can be changed at any time in the Phone AI settings. Changes take effect immediately.

## Additional Settings

Besides voice selection, you can also adjust the following parameters in the Phone AI settings:

- **Speaking speed**: Adjust the pace of speech output
- **Pitch**: Change the voice pitch as needed
