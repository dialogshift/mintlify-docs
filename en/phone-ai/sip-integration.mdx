## What we need from you

<Note>
  Your phone system must be SIP-capable and allow registrations via the internet.
</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set up SIP account">
    Separate account specifically for Phone AI
  </Step>
  <Step title="Provide access data">
    Complete SIP access data (see below)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Forwarding targets">
    Either a single internal target number (extension or group) or up to four department-specific targets to which calls can be forwarded based on the topic.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Required SIP Access Data

**Always required:**

- Username (without spaces)
- Password
- Endpoint (URL or IP address)
- Port

**If available:**

- Proxy (URL or IP address)

## Additional Requirements

### Local Phone Systems

You need **one** of the following options:

- **Fixed IP address** (IPv4 or IPv6)
- **Dynamic DNS** (there may be brief interruptions during IP changes)

<Info>
  Cloud phone systems are already accessible via the internet.
</Info>

### Internal transfers

Please provide the internal target number (extension or group). Alternatively, you can provide up to four department-specific target numbers. The Phone AI decides contextually which target to transfer to.

<Info>
  Important: At any given time, only one behavior is active â€” either forwarding to the target number <em>or</em> taking a callback request / no forwarding. A combination is not possible.
</Info>

Optionally, time-based activation of forwarding can be configured via the schedule in the settings.
