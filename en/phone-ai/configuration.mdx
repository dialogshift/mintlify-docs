You can find the Phone AI configuration page under: **Settings** >> **Phone AI**

## Greeting

The greeting is the text that welcomes callers at the beginning of the conversation. The spelling can be phonetically adjusted, especially for brand names.

<Note>
Our Customer Success team will help you find the right spelling if the pronunciation doesn't meet your expectations.
</Note>

## Forward Duplicate Calls

If a caller calls again within X seconds, the call is forwarded directly to the stored phone number. The configured value determines the time period in seconds during which a repeated call from the same number is automatically redirected to the defined target number.

## SMS Sender

Alphanumeric sender ID for sent SMS messages (max. 11 characters)

## Booking Request Template

This SMS and WhatsApp template is used when callers with a mobile number express a booking request. Templates can be customized under **Journey Messaging** >> **Message Templates**.

## Phone Number for Forwarding

Upon customer request or in case of technical problems with the Phone AI, callers are automatically forwarded to this number.

## Forwarding targets

You can provide either a single internal target number (extension or group) or up to four department-specific target numbers (e.g., Reservations, Reception, Spa, Restaurant). The Phone AI decides contextually during the conversation which of the stored targets to forward to. This configuration is set up by our Customer Success team (support@dialogshift.com).

## Time Management for Phone AI

When configuring the Phone AI, you have three different options available to control how the AI should handle call forwarding or callback requests:

<Info>
  Important: At any given time, only one behavior is active â€” either forwarding to the target number <em>or</em> taking a callback request / no forwarding.
</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Always allow AI to forward to a human">
    When this option is activated:
    - The Phone AI forwards the caller to the configured forwarding number upon request
    - Alternatively, it forwards based on the topic to one of up to four configured departments
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="AI may not forward to a human">
    With this setting, you must choose one of two sub-options:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Take callback request">
        - The Phone AI informs the caller that no one is currently available
        - It takes a callback request and records the caller's concern
        - The callback request is stored in the Dialogshift app
        - All users are notified through usual channels:
          - Email
          - Desktop notifications
          - Device notifications on Android and iOS (native app must be installed)
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="No staff available">
        - The Phone AI tells the caller that the call cannot currently be answered
        - The caller is asked to contact the hotel via email
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Allow AI to forward to a human based on a schedule">
    When selecting this option:
    - A scheduler widget opens
    - Here you can set the times when phone forwarding is allowed
    - For times outside the set schedule, both options are available:
      - "Take callback request"
      - "No staff available"
  </Step>
