You can find the Phone AI configuration page under: **Settings** >> **Phone AI**

## Greeting

The greeting is the text that welcomes callers at the beginning of the conversation. The spelling can be phonetically adjusted, especially for brand names.

<Note>
Our Customer Success team will help you find the right spelling if the pronunciation doesn't meet your expectations.
</Note>

## Forward Duplicate Calls

If a caller calls again within X seconds, the call is forwarded directly to the stored phone number. The configured value determines the time period in seconds during which a repeated call from the same number is automatically redirected to the defined target number.

## SMS Sender

Alphanumeric sender ID for sent SMS messages (max. 11 characters)

## Booking Request Template

This SMS and WhatsApp template is used when callers with a mobile number express a booking request. Templates can be customized under **Journey Messaging** >> **Message Templates**.

## Phone Number for Forwarding

Upon customer request or in case of technical problems with the Phone AI, callers are automatically forwarded to this number.

## Forwarding to Different Internal Teams or Numbers

You can set up topic-specific forwarding to different numbers. Since this also involves AI training, this configuration is set up by our Customer Success team (support@dialogshift.com).

<Info>
For example, you can set up forwarding to departments like Reservations, Reception, Pool, and Spa.

## Time Management for Phone AI

When configuring the Phone AI, you have three different options available to control how the AI should handle call forwarding or callback requests:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Always allow AI to forward to a human">
    When this option is activated:
    - The Phone AI forwards the caller to the configured forwarding number upon request
    - Alternatively, forwarding can be done to predefined departments
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="AI may not forward to a human">
    With this setting, you must choose one of two sub-options:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Take callback request">
        - The Phone AI informs the caller that no one is currently available
        - It takes a callback request and records the caller's concern
        - The callback request is stored in the Dialogshift app
        - All users are notified through usual channels:
          - Email
          - Desktop notifications
          - Device notifications on Android and iOS (native app must be installed)
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="No staff available">
        - The Phone AI tells the caller that the call cannot currently be answered
        - The caller is asked to contact the hotel via email
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Allow AI to forward to a human based on a schedule">
    When selecting this option:
    - A scheduler widget opens
    - Here you can set the times when phone forwarding is allowed
    - For times outside the set schedule, both options are available:
      - "Take callback request"
      - "No staff available"
  </Step>
</Steps>
