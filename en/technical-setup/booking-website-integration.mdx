description: "Information we need to connect DialogShift to your Web Booking Engine"
---

<Note>
The connection to your booking website (Web Booking Engine, WBE) is typically implemented by the DialogShift technical team as part of the chatbot setup.
</Note>

## Required information

Please provide the following so we can prefill the booking mask correctly:

- **Booking engine base URL**: The URL where your booking widget is accessible
- **Supported URL parameters for pre-filling**:
  - Check-in date (e.g., `checkin`)
  - Check-out date (e.g., `checkout`)
  - Number of adults (e.g., `adults`)
  - Number and age of children (e.g., `children`, `child_age`)

<Tip>
If needed, ask your WBE provider for a list of supported parameters and the expected date and number formats.
</Tip>

## Example URL

Below is a schematic example of what a parameterized link might look like. Actual parameter names and formats vary by provider.

```text
https://booking.example-hotel.com/booking?
  checkin=2025-09-15&
  checkout=2025-09-17&
  adults=2&
  children=1&
  child_age=5
```

<Info>
If your booking engine supports additional parameters (e.g., offer/rate codes, promo codes, room categories), please share those as well.
