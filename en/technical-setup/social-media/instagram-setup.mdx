## Overview

This guide shows you how to connect Instagram Messenger with DialogShift so your chatbot can automatically respond to Instagram direct messages.

## Prerequisites

Instagram chatbots only work with specific settings and connections:

<Note>
A professional Instagram business account is mandatory. Personal Instagram accounts are not supported.
</Note>

### What you need:
- An Instagram Business account (not a personal account)
- A Facebook page linked to the Instagram account
- Admin rights on both Instagram and the Facebook page

## Step 1: Set up Instagram Business Account

### Check Account Type

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check current account type">
    1. Open Instagram on your smartphone
    2. Go to **"Settings"**
    3. Look for the **"Business"** section
    
    <Info>
    If you see the "Business" section in settings, you already have a business account.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Switch to Business Account" condition="If not yet a business account">

### Why a Business Account?

<Accordion title="Technical Background">
  Meta (the parent company of Instagram and Facebook) uses the same messenger infrastructure for both platforms. To integrate chatbots in Instagram, business accounts with extended API access are required.

## Step 2: Connect Instagram to Facebook Page

This is a mandatory requirement from Meta. Each Instagram account must be assigned to exactly one Facebook page (1-to-1 connection).
