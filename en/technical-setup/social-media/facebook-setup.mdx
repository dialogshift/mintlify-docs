## Overview

This guide shows you how to connect Facebook Messenger with DialogShift so your chatbot can automatically respond to Facebook messages.

## Prerequisites

<Note>
You need admin rights on your hotel's Facebook page to set up the integration.
</Note>

### What you need:
- A Facebook page for your hotel
- A Facebook user with **admin rights** on this page
- Access to the DialogShift Live Chat app

## Step-by-Step Guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prepare Facebook Page">
    Make sure you have a professional Facebook page for your hotel and possess admin rights.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Disable Automatic Greetings">
    Disable automatic greetings and FAQs in the Facebook postbox so the DialogShift chatbot can take over:
    
    1. Go to [Facebook Business Inbox](https://business.facebook.com/latest/inbox/automated_responses)
    2. Disable automatic responses
    3. Disable FAQ functions
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set up Integration in DialogShift">
    1. Open the DialogShift Live Chat app
    2. Navigate to **"Settings" >> "Integrations"**
    3. Click **"Login"** or **"Renew Login"** for Facebook
    4. Log in with your Facebook account (that has admin rights)
    5. Select your Facebook page
    6. Enable all requested permissions
    7. Click **"Save"**
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Facebook Login Renewal

<Warning>
Facebook requires login renewal every 3 months. You'll receive timely email reminders from us.
</Warning>

### How to renew the login:
1. Go to **"Settings" >> "Integrations"** in the DialogShift app
2. Click **"Renew Login"** for Facebook
3. Confirm the connection again

## Setup for Hotel Chains

If you have Facebook pages only at brand level (not for individual hotels):

<Accordion title="Setup for Brand Facebook Pages">
  **Recommended approach:**
  
  1. Connect the brand Facebook page with any hotel or landing chatbot
  2. Open **"Settings" >> "Channel Settings"**
  3. Disable the chatbot for Facebook ("Chatbot active")
  4. Enable a channel-specific greeting
  5. Contact support@dialogshift.com for setting up a dedicated inbox
  
  **Result:** All Facebook chats are collected in a central mailbox that can be handled by all hotels.
</Accordion>

## Chatbot Configuration

After integration, you can make additional settings:

### Channel-Specific Settings
- **Chatbot Mode:** Fully automatic, hybrid, or live chat only
- **Greeting Messages:** Customize the first message
- **Handover Rules:** When to transfer to live chat

### Advanced Configuration for Social Media Teams

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Story Interactions">
    - Chatbot doesn't respond to story replies
    - Chatbot doesn't respond to story mentions
    - Better separation between chatbot and social media team

  <Tab title="Media Uploads">
