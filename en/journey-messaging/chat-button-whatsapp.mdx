How to integrate chat buttons or WhatsApp buttons into Journey emails.

## Why Integrate Chat Buttons in Emails?

At the end of an email, it makes sense to provide guests with the option to contact via chat. This enables seamless communication and increases the likelihood that guests will directly contact the hotel with questions or concerns.

## Available Button Options

This can be done in two ways:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Chat with Us Button">
    **The Chat with Us Button**
    - Links directly to the web chat
    - Always available, regardless of booked channels
    - Opens the DialogShift web chat on the hotel website
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="WhatsApp Button">
    **The WhatsApp Click-to-Chat Button**
    - Only available if the hotel has booked the WhatsApp channel with DialogShift
    - Opens WhatsApp directly with the hotel chat
    - Particularly convenient for mobile users
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
In both cases, the chat bot automatically responds to further inquiries from the user afterwards.

## Integration into Journey Emails

### Step-by-Step Guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Email Template">
    Open the Journey email template into which you want to integrate the chat button
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Determine Button Position">
    Choose the optimal position for the chat button:
    - **At the end of the email**: Classic placement after the main content
    - **In the signature**: Discreet integration into the email signature
    - **As call-to-action**: Prominent placement in the main text
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Choose Button Type">
    Decide between:
    - **Chat with us button** for general contact option
    - **WhatsApp button** for mobile-optimized communication (if available)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Customize Design">
    Adapt the button design:
    - Color according to hotel corporate identity
    - Size and placement
    - Adjust accompanying text
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

### Optimal Placement
- **End of email**: After main content, before signature
- **Visible but not intrusive**: The button should stand out but not distract from the main content
