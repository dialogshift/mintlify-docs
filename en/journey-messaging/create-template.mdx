Create a template to reach your guests with a message across different channels and in different languages.

## Navigation

**Journey Messaging** >> **Message Templates** >> **New Message Template**

## What is a Template?

A template is actually a bundle of different sub-templates on the same topic. With us, you create a separate template for each channel and each language.

### Example

You want to send a request for online check-in. You want to use WhatsApp first and email as a fallback. Your hotel supports the primary languages German and English.

You should now create four sub-templates:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="WhatsApp">
    - WhatsApp, German
    - WhatsApp, English
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Email">
    - Email, German
    - Email, English
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Creating the Template

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start New Message Template">
    After clicking **New Message Template**, you can decide:
    
    - **Blank Template**: Start with a completely empty template
    - **Design Templates**: Use the beautifully designed templates from our collection and then customize them
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Channels and Languages">
    Create a separate sub-template for each desired channel and language:
    
    - Choose the communication channel (WhatsApp, Email, SMS)
    - Determine the language of the message
    - Design the content according to the channel
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Customize Content">
    Adapt the content of your template:
    
    - Use personalized placeholders
    - Consider the specifics of each channel
    - Test the template before activation
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Using Your Own Templates as a Basis for Other Messages

<Note>
If you have already created a template for different channels and different languages, it's easy to duplicate this template to at least take over the design for the next message.
</Note>

### Duplicate Template

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Template">
    Navigate to the template you want to use as a basis
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Duplicate">
    Click on the **three dots** in the upper right area and then on **Duplicate Template**
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Customize">
    Edit the duplicated template according to your wishes:
    - Change the content according to the new message
    - Adjust channels and languages if needed
    - Give a meaningful name to the new template
  </Step>
</Steps>
