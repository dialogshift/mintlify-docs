### Working Mode

The working mode has three settings:

- **Active** - This is the setting for later operation. All messages are sent to guests.
- **Redirect messages** - You can now enter your own email address. All messages that would normally be sent to guests are now redirected to this entered email address. You can see in a mailbox what the messages would look like.
- **Send no messages** - No messages are sent. This is the off switch.

### Sender Name

This should contain the clear text sender name of the hotel. The sender address is always noreply@dialogshift.

### Reply Address

The hotel's email address should be entered here. If the guest clicks "Reply" in their email program, it will be sent to this address.

## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Design Template">
    Navigate to Journey Messaging >> Message Templates

    Create your first template by choosing a blank template or selecting one of the DialogShift design templates.

    **A template corresponds to the message on a topic, for example a booking confirmation, a check-in request, or sending the door opening link.**

    When creating, you choose a first variant for a channel and a first language. Don't worry, you can create more variants afterwards.

    Create more templates by duplicating your first template and thus copying your design from one template to the next.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Language Variants for Additional Languages">
    When you're done with the first variant, you can create additional language variants. It's recommended to first cover all other languages of your hotel.

    Click on the "Duplicate variant" icon.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Channel Variants of the Template">
    If you want to reach your guests on more than one channel, you should now create more variants for other channels. Channels are email, WhatsApp and SMS.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Create More Templates for Other Topics">
    If you want to create a template for a completely new topic, you don't have to start from scratch.

    Click here to duplicate an already existing template with all variants, so you can start modifying this template for a new topic.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a Flow Based on an Event">
    Navigate to Journey Messaging >> Journey Flows

    Create a name here and then select the triggering event.

    If you want to send a booking confirmation, for example, the triggering event is "Reservation in PMS". With the + sign you can now add various actions to the flow. The main action is of course sending a template that you created earlier. But you can also add delays if you want to send different templates based on the same event.

    **Example of a flow:**

    1. Guest books room (-> Event "PMS: Reservation")
    2. Immediately the "Booking confirmation" template is sent (Preference WhatsApp, Email as fallback)
    3. Then Journey Messaging waits 1 day
    4. After one day the "Upsell" template is sent (Preference WhatsApp, Email as fallback)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test the Flow">
    Make sure that Journey Messaging is in "Redirect messages" mode.

    Settings >> Journey Messaging

    Now wait to see how your guests' bookings are processed by the system. You will only receive the messages in the email box you specified.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set the System Live">
    When you are satisfied with the result of your configuration, switch the mode to "Active"

    Settings >> Journey Messaging

    Your guests will now receive the messages.
  </Step>
