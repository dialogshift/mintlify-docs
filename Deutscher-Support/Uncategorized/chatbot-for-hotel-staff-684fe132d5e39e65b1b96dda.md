Our AI chatbot was originally designed to enhance digital guest communication – but it can also provide valuable support for your **hotel staff**. Especially when onboarding new team members or sharing operational knowledge, the chatbot becomes a practical and scalable solution.

##  **Option 1: Staff Access to the Existing Guest Chatbot**

 **(free of charge)**

Your existing guest-facing chatbot (e.g. on your website) can also be made accessible to staff through:

  *  **QR codes** placed in staff areas or on printed materials
  *  **Integration into an existing employee app**
  *  **Linking on intranet pages or staff tablets**

  


This is particularly useful for new team members who are still getting to know your hotel – offering a simple way to access important information anytime, in multiple languages!

  


>  **Note:** This option comes at no additional cost. Just let us know how and where your team should access the chatbot, and we’ll handle the integration into your web or app interfaces.

  


* * *

##  **Option 2: Dedicated Internal Chatbot with Custom Knowledge Base**

 **(€50/month + one-time setup fee of €250)**

  


Alternatively, you can set up a **separate internal chatbot** that is exclusively available to your team and tailored to internal hotel operations. This version can be populated with custom content such as:

  * How do I create an invoice?
  * What should I consider for early check-outs?
  * What is the process for shift changes?

  
  


>  **Important:** No login is required – anyone with access via QR code or app tile can use the chatbot.

  


This solution is ideal for creating a standardized, easy-to-maintain internal knowledge base.

  


##  **Your Key Benefits**

  
  


✅ **Low-threshold access** : Staff can easily access information anytime, anywhere – even in multiple languages.

✅ **Simplified knowledge transfer** : Especially helpful for onboarding new employees or providing daily operational support.

✅ **Consistent information** : Everyone accesses the same verified content – no matter the shift or department.

✅ **Fewer errors** : Centralized knowledge reduces the risk of misinformation and mistakes in daily processes.

  


Both options are already in use by other customers. We’re happy to support you in setting up the best solution for your internal needs.
